# Centralized Data Ingestion Service with Aiven Kafka 
##- A quick start for Java and Springboot
Aiven for Apache Kafka is a fully managed distributed data streaming platform, deployable in the cloud of your choice. Apache Kafka is an open source data streaming platform, ideal for event-driven applications, near-real-time data transfer and pipelines, stream analytics, and many more applications where a lot of data needs to move between applications in a speedy manner.

Data platform developers or application developers need to ingest the data generated by applications to Kafka cluster for stream processing. Based on Aiven Kafka, this tutorial presents how to use Springboot framework to build a Kafka producing service. The tutorial contains 4 steps, including create an Aiven Kafka Service, setting up Java SSL access, Springboot integration, and local testing. 

##Create Aiven Kafka Service

##Configure Java SSL Access
Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® utilises TLS (SSL) to secure the traffic between its services and client applications. This means that clients must be configured with the right tools to be able to communicate with the Aiven services.

Keystores and truststores are password-protected files accessible by the client that interacts with the service. To create these files:

- Log into the Aiven web console and select your Aiven for Apache Kafka service.

- Download the Access Key, Access Certificate and CA Certificate, as is shown on the picture. The resulting **service.key**, **service.cert** and **ca.pem** are going to be used in the following steps.

- Use the openssl utility to create the keystore with the service.key and service.cert files downloaded previously:
```
openssl pkcs12 -export       \
-inkey service.key        \
-in service.cert           \
-out client.keystore.p12 \
-name service_key      
```
- Enter a password to protect the keystore and the key, when prompted.
- In the folder where the certificates are stored, use the keytool utility to create the truststore with the ca.pem file as input:
 ```
keytool -import  \
  -file ca.pem \
  -alias CA    \
  -keystore client.truststore.jks
```

- Enter a password to protect the truststores, when prompted. Reply to yes to confirm trusting the CA certificate, when prompted.
- The result are the keystore named client.keystore.p12 and truststore named client.truststore.jks that can be used for client applications configuration. 
- Make sure **kafka_authentication_methods.certificate** is enabled on the bottom of the overview page of your Kafka service.
